# Creating-a-video-stream-on-social-media
This project was made for a Data Science class about machine learning at UCLouvain (University in Belgium). A video stream has been created, using a french trending videos dataset. It's a Keras based code implying some simple machine learning NCF neural networks. 

You first need to upload the csv file containing the dataset on your computer. The file being too heavy, it is not possible to load it on Github directly. Here's the link of the Kaggle page containing the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset . The dataset used is "FR_youtube_trending_data.csv . 

After that, you can run the code in your anaconda command prompt (Not sure if it works with other environments but feel free to try out). Don't forget to install Keras, Tensorflow and Streamlit in your anaconda environment beforehand (and any other libraries or packages required). Enjoy the project !
